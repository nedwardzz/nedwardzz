### ⚡ Fun fact

I enjoy volunteering. 

I often volunteer with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog), come check out the free courses (some pathways are paid), the community, and join one of the many events to get started with your IT journey!

I'm the Club Captain for the Boston Club in particular, [check it out here](https://community.codecademy.com/c/boston/)!

📅 I host 1 event per month focused on fundamental micro technical skills.

A component of learning is further solidifying it by teaching it to others, and in that experience, I may also refine myself, my understanding, approaches and perspective through empiricism and hearing from other's experiences and perspective.

📌 *Heads up — I’m not sponsored by Codecademy, I just think their stuff is neat!*
