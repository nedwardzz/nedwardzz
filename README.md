## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I'm Nick Edwards — a junior software engineer focused on building backend microservices.  
I'm on a journey to grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer.

### 💼 Professional Background

With 12+ years across the manufacturing and IT industries, I've held roles including:
- Product Team Lead  
- Business Systems Analyst  
- FinOps Practitioner  
- Scrum Master  

I have a B.S. in Business Administration and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.  
Throughout my career, I’ve led numerous value-driven and waste-reduction projects, optimizing workflows for cross-functional teams of 5 to 30+ people.

### 🧠 Why I Code

I'm deeply curious about how systems work — especially the ones that power the operations I’ve spent my career improving.  
My goal is to bridge business expertise with technical skills, and become a versatile full-stack developer who builds scalable, impactful solutions.
